Write a class called Password_manager. 
The class should have a list called old_passwords that holds all of the 
user’s past passwords. The last item of the list is the user’s current password.
There should be a method called get_password that returns the current password
and a method called set_password that sets the user’s password. The set_password
method should only change the password if the attempted password is different 
from all the user’s past passwords. Finally, create a method called is_correct 
that receives a string and returns a boolean True or False depending on 
whether the string is equal to the current password or not.

class Password_manager:
	def __init__(self,passwords):
		self.passwords = passwords

	def show_passwords(self):
		for i in range(len(self.passwords)):
			print (self.passwords[i])

	def get_password(self):
		return self.passwords[len(self.passwords)-1]

	def set_password(self,string):
		if string not in self.passwords:
			self.passwords.append(string)
			return 1
                else:
			return 0

	def is_correct(self,string):
		if self.passwords[len(self.passwords)-1] == string:
			return True
		else:
		  	return False
	
p = ['123','456','789']
p1 = Password_manager(p)
p1.show_passwords()
print ("Current Password is ", p1.get_password())
p1.set_password('hello')
print ("Current Password is ", p1.get_password())

if p1.set_password('hello1'):
	print ("Password changed")
else:
	print ("Password not changed")

print (p1.is_correct('hello1'))
